# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to the advent of code for the following years:
- 2023 (partial)
- 2024

### 2023
This year c++ was the language of choice. The goal was to learn more about writing C++ code.

### 2024
This year Python (especially with numpy) was the language of choice. The goal is to get comfortable with tensor operations such as broadcasting in NumPy. Therefore, after the completion of each day's tasks the goal is to fully vectorize the implementation.
